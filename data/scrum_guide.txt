# THE SPRINT SENSE AGILE HANDBOOK & SCRUM GUIDE

## SECTION 1: CORE SCRUM VALUES
1. Commitment: People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.
2. Focus: Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team.
3. Openness: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work.
4. Respect: Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.
5. Courage: The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.

## SECTION 2: MANAGING COGNITIVE LOAD (MENTAL STATES)
Rule 2.1: Sustainable Pace
Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- If a team member shows signs of "Fatigue" (High Delta Waves), they must be encouraged to take a break or reduce their velocity for the next Sprint.
- Overworking leads to technical debt and burnout.

Rule 2.2: Context Switching
Focus is essential for complex tasks.
- If a team member shows "High Stress" (High Beta Waves), it often indicates excessive context switching or interruptions.
- The Scrum Master must protect the team from external distractions.
- Limit Work In Progress (WIP) to prevent cognitive overload.

Rule 2.3: Psychological Safety
- "Anxiety" (High Beta/Alpha Ratio) kills innovation.
- Team members must feel safe to admit they are stuck or do not understand a requirement.
- If anxiety is detected, the Manager should review the "Definition of Ready" to ensure tasks are clear before assignment.

## SECTION 3: SCRUM EVENTS & ARTIFACTS
Rule 3.1: The Sprint
A Sprint is a fixed length event of one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.
- During the Sprint: No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal.
- Quality goals do not decrease.
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

Rule 3.2: Daily Scrum
The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team.
- It is not a status meeting for management.
- It is for the team to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

Rule 3.3: Sprint Retrospective
The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.
- Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools.
- Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements.

## SECTION 4: ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES
Rule 4.1: The Product Owner
- Maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team.
- Managing the Product Backlog.

Rule 4.2: The Scrum Master
- Helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values.
- Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress.
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.

Rule 4.3: The Developers
- Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog.
- Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done.
- Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal.

## SECTION 5: ROLE-SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS (THE "SPRINTSENSE" MATRIX)

### 5.1 PROTOCOLS FOR AI & ML ENGINEERS
**Context:** AI Engineers often face "Model Convergence Anxiety" and long wait times for training.
- **Symptom:** High Beta Waves (Stress) + Low Confidence.
  - **Root Cause:** Model is not learning or NaN loss.
  - **Action:** The Manager should pair the engineer with a Senior Data Scientist for a "Architecture Review." Do not pressure for results; focus on the experiment process.
- **Symptom:** High Delta (Fatigue) + High GPU Usage.
  - **Root Cause:** Late night monitoring of training runs.
  - **Action:** Automate stopping criteria. Enforce "Rest State" while models train overnight.

### 5.2 PROTOCOLS FOR DEVOPS & SRE
**Context:** DevOps roles are high-interrupt environments due to incidents and pager duty.
- **Symptom:** Spiking Beta/Gamma Waves (Acute Stress).
  - **Root Cause:** Active P0/P1 Incident or "Firefighting" mode.
  - **Action:** 1. IMMUNITY: The Scrum Master must block all non-incident work.
    2. ROTATION: If stress persists > 4 hours, swap the on-call engineer immediately.
- **Symptom:** Chronic Theta (Distraction).
  - **Root Cause:** Alert fatigue from too many non-critical notifications.
  - **Action:** Review alert thresholds in the next Retrospective.

### 5.3 PROTOCOLS FOR FRONTEND & BACKEND DEVS
**Context:** Feature delivery pressure and integration hell.
- **Symptom:** High Beta (Anxiety) + "Deadline Approaching" signal.
  - **Root Cause:** Integration mismatch between Frontend and Backend.
  - **Action:** "Swarming." The entire team pauses their work to help the blocked member finish the interface.
- **Symptom:** Low Alpha (No Flow State).
  - **Root Cause:** Too many meetings or "Context Switching."
  - **Action:** Institute "No-Meeting Tuesdays" to allow deep work.

## SECTION 6: INTERPRETING BIOMETRIC SIGNALS (EEG MAPPING)
The SprintSense System uses synthetic EEG to measure team health.
1. **The "Zone" (Optimal State):** Balanced Alpha and Beta waves. The user is alert but calm. Manager Action: Do not disturb.
2. **"Burnout Risk" (Danger State):** High Delta waves during work hours. This indicates sleep deprivation. Manager Action: Send home immediately.
3. **"Panic" (Critical State):** High Beta waves (>25Hz). This indicates "Fight or Flight." Manager Action: Remove the blocker causing the panic.
